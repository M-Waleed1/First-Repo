To make a tuple with one element 
`mytuple = "Leda", `
`mytuple = ("Leda",)`

concatenate: 
tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2

Repeat:
My-Tuple * 6

Count:
`tuple.count(value)

index:
`tuple.index(value)`

Destruct:
divide tuple into variables

```
a = ("a", "b", "c")
x, y, z = a
```

To avoid a variable give it ( _ )
```
a =(1, 2, 3, 4)
x, y, _, z = a
output
x = 1
y = 2
z = 4
```
