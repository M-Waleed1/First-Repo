Start in Python it's easy and clean language 
just start 1 Step at day and will be a good step for You 
just do 1% at day

# Syntax[3]
---
1. Print Function: 
   `print("Any text")`
2. Syntax:
   Python depend on ==WHITE-SPACE== 
   `if true:
   `   print()`
this called white-space
To Write a code in one line can put `;` after first code
Like
`print("Hello, "); Print("World!")`

To detail The code 
```
# single line comment
/*

# Dealing With Data[5]

Data can Categorized into 3 categories
Number --> refers to the numerical data
String --> refers to the text data
Boolean --> Refers to True or False

Stores the data on memory can called Variable
Variable not containing the data but refers to its location 

the operation on data can be 
1. Add
2. Delete 
3. Edit
--- 
# Data Types[6]

> All data in python is object

we have a built in function called
type() --> Give the type of the data 
`type(10) --> int`

Data Types
1. 100, -50, 1, 0 --> `int` 
   Integer(INT) any numerical value not fraction
2. -1.5, 11.50, 0.29854 --> `float` 
   Float any numerical value With a decimal point
3. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] --> `list` 
   Is a non homogenous data structure allows duplicate
4. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) --> `tuple` 
   Is a non homogenous data structure allows duplicate
5. {"One" : 1 , "Two" : 2} --> `Dict = Dictionary` 
   Represented by key("One") and value (1)
6. "Ahmed , "Wael" --> `String` 
   All the text data can be written
7. (2 == 2), (3 == 2) --> `boolean` 
   Boolean(Bool) is the data can be True or False
8. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} --> `set`
   Is a non homogenous data structure that not allows duplicate

Integer --> `(int)` --> -100, 100, 541286, -8459521
`print(type(1254)) --> int`

Float --> -15.2158, 21.3215
`print(type(-5.2454)) --> float`

Complex --> 5+6j,-5-68j
`print(type(5+8j)) --> complex`

>[!note]
>To print real part `variable.real`
>To print imagine part `variable.imag` 

>[!important]
> - You can convert Integer to Float
> - you can convert Float to Integer
> - you can not convert Complex to any type

To convert
- `float() --> To Float`
- `int() --> To Integer`
- `complex() --> To Complex`

# Operators
---

- + addition --> 5+5 = 10
- - subtraction --> 5-5 = 0 
- * Multiplication 5 * 2=10
- / division --> 10/2 = 5.0 --> Float
- % modulus --> 10%3 = 1
- ** Exponent --> 5 ** 2 =25
- // Floor Division 10//2 = 5 --> Integer
  13//2 = 6
