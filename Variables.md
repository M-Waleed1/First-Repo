**variables**

Syntax:
variable = value

Rules for naming the variable:

1. can start with (a-z/A-Z) or underscore(_)
2. can't start with number 
3. can't start with special character(@,$,#,...) 
4. case sensitive language (a != A) 
5. can include numbers (0-9) --> a12

Method to assign name to variable:

1. Normal = value --> single word
2. CamelCase = value --> two words or more
3. `snake_case` = value --> two words or more

Def:
1. source code: Original code you write
2. Translation: Converting code into machine language
3. Compilation: Translate code before run
4. Run-Time: Period app take to executing commands
5. interpreted: Code translated on the fly during execution
